# Capstone-project
Final capstone project for sigma labs pre-work. Centred on making a 'hangman' game.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

To play the game, simply run the file and follow the instructions.
The aim of the game is to guess a word which the computer has selected at random.
You will first be told the length of the word, along with the unknown letters as underscores.
You are then prompted to choose to either solve the word based on the current information, or to guess a letter and see if it is in the word.
If the letter is in the word, all instances of it will be revealed and no lives will be lost.
If not, a life is lost and part of 'the hangman' is drawn.
Once 10 lives have been reached without the user guessing correctly or filling in all letters, 'the hangman' is completed and the game is lost.
If the user solves correctly or fills in all letters before 10 the lives are used, the game is won and the number of guesses taken is displayed (along with the current state of the hangman)

Enjoy!
